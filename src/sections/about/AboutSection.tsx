        While earning my bachelor's degree in <span>Telecommunications</span>{' '}
        and my master's degree in <span>Cybersecurity</span>, I discovered a
        deep passion for programming. During my studies, I worked full-time as a
        mobile software developer and have since transitioned into{' '}
        <span>full-stack web development</span>, a field I find both challenging
        and incredibly rewarding.
        <br />
        <br />
        <em>When I&apos;m not coding</em>, I enjoy playing and watching all
        kinds of sports, getting lost in books, and exploring nature through
        hiking. I&apos;m a <u>lifelong learner</u> currently diving into{' '}
        <span>theology and philosophy</span>. Music is another passion of
        mineâ€”I&apos;m always looking for opportunities to play the guitar,
        piano, or sing.
